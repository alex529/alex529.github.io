# Part 1: Telling Data Stories

The questions below refer to *Edward Segel and Jeffrey Heer*. [**Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data.**](http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2010-Narrative-InfoVis.pdf)

## What is the Oxford English Dictionary's defintion of a narrative?

The definition of narrative in the  Oxford English Dictionary is:
> *An account of a series of events, facts, etc., given in order and with the establishing of connections between them*; a narration, a story, an account.

## What is your favorite visualization among the examples in section 3? Explain why in a few words.

The first visualization **Steroids Or Not, the Pursuit is On. New York Times.** is the one that is most visually appealing to me, the graphics and colors are very nice but the thing that impressed me the most is the amount of information that was squeezed in single page. And having all that data organized in such a way that it is easy to fallow, and at the end its eye pleasing.

## What's the point of Figure 7?

Figure 7 is used help the reader to visualize how the paper authors did their research. The Figure shows: the analysed visualizations, the criteria used to make the analysis, and how each visualization "scored" by each criteria. The Figure also highlights 4 patterns. 

## Use Figure 7 to find the most common design choice within each category for the Visual narrative and Narrative structure (the categories within visual narrative are 'visual structuring', 'highlighting', etc).

Visual Narrative

+ Visual structuring: Consistent visual platform **59%**
+ Highlighting: Feature Distinction **79%**
+ Transition Guidance: Object Continuity **38%**

Narrative Structure

+ Ordering: User Directed Path **53%**
+ Interactivity: Very limited Integrity **60%**
+ Messaging: Captions/Headlines **84%**
