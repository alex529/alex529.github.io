                                            Los Angeles is the second most populous city in Unites States, it has a population of about 4 millions and represents a very important financial, cultural and commercial
                                            hub on the West coast. There is a lot of data about Los Angeles and in this article the arrests will be discussed in depth. There are important facts that have to be 
                                            analyzed and we a going to focus on four main questions: 
                                        <ul>
                                            <li> <b> WHERE </b> are the arrests being made? Where are the safe and dangerous areas in the city?  </li>
                                            <li> <b> WHO </b> is mainly getting arrested? Do we have any race/gender that is mainly responsible for making illegal things?</li>                                            
                                            <li> <b> WHEN </b> do we have the most arrests? Do we see any trend that can lead to some conclusions? </li>
                                            <li> <b> HOW </b> did people get arrested? What are the main reasons for getting arrested in Los Angeles? </li>
                                        </ul>
                                            The questions mentioned above represent our foundation for further analysis, the expectations are to answer the questions and in the same time to come up with a discussion 
                                            about past/future trends that characterize the city of Los Angeles.  
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            In terms of <b> Narrative Visualization Genre </b>, it will represent a mix between <b> Magazine Style </b> and <b> Annotated Charts </b> mainly, including different iterative visualizations and 
                                            discussions about analyzed results. A special focus will be put on underlying how the visualization helped to get this results and how it facilitated realizing some trends that
                                            might derive after analysis of such data.

                                    Here is the video that was initially made as the first step towards creating the narrative visualization. The major change that can be spotted is the genre which was initially selected as 
                                    a Slide Show, but after analyzing the user experience it was decided that the Magazine Style in combination with the Annotated chart will provide a nicer experience for the user, so that he/she
                                    can read it like a short story about arrests in Los Angeles.

                                        <p> In order to get the real insights of the arrests in respect to gender and races, two scatter plots were made: 
                                            <ul>
                                                <li> <b>Total Number of Arrests:</b> In this scenario the  total number of arrests is shown, it can be seen the strong male numbers dominance over females, 
                                                     as well as the primary races in terms of total numbers in the following order: Hispanic, Black, White, Other and Asians races. </li>
                                                <li> <b>Number of Arrests per 1000:</b> Even though the total number shows the most arrests by gender and race, it can be misleading due to the fact that 
                                                     the number is strongly correlated with the total number of inhabitants by race. As a result, the second scatter plot shows the number of arrests per 1000
                                                     inhabitants of the total gender/race population. The results of this analysis show some interesting insights that were not covered by the first scatter plot, 
                                                     especially in the race difference, even though Hispanic have the most arrests in the total count, because of their higher population, the number per 1000 is 
                                                     actually closer to the White race than to the black one. In the end, the blacks race tops up with a huge difference compared to the rest of the races, followed by
                                                     Other race type which in the first scatter plot was in the bottom, but taking it into consideration to the total population it comes second actually, Hispanic and White come 
                                                     next and the Asians still have the last spot in terms of arrests. Regarding gender difference, the same huge gap between males and females applies because their population is
                                                     almost equal.
                                               </li>
                                            </ul>
                                             Another interesting fact that is reviled from the scatter plots, is the overall trend which is declining over the last 8 years and it applies to all races and genders.    
                                        </p>
                                        <h4> Percentage comparison of arrests based on gender and race in Donut Charts  </h4>
                                        <p> After the analysis of arrests in the Scatter plots, the Donut Charts bring a visual representation of arrests over all 8 years in one picture, not over time. This represents 
                                            an easy way to realize the ranking of gender and races in terms of number of arrests. </p>

                                        <p> The ranking based on races is dominated by Hispanic having close to 50%, followed by the Black and White Race. Other races and Asians have
                                            a very small contribution of less than 6%. On the over side the total race population has to be taken into account when looking into these numbers
                                            as shown in the Scatter plot with "Number of Arrests per 1000". </p>
                                         <p> On the gender side the dominance of males in terms of arrest is very clear, close to 80 % of arrests is represented by males.  </p>

                            Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?

                            What was your goal for the end user’s experience?
                            
                            -->

                            <p>
                                The driving force for selecting a final dataset was mainly to be able to analyze a lot of data and to come up with a story for the user.
                                As a result the selected dataset represents the Arrests in Los Angeles, it consists of 1.16 millions rows and 17 columns, showing the information 
                                such as personal information (race, gender), type or arrest(murder, drunkenness etc.), location of the arrest etc. Combining all these data can
                                result in a wide analysis of arrest in the second biggest city in United States. In addition to the actual analysis, we created a story line 
                                in the following manner: there are 4 main questions to be answered so that the user will get the whole picture of arrest in Los Angeles. The 
                                questions are the following: where did the arrest happen? who did it? when did it happen? and how was it made (what type of arrest was made).
                                Answering these basic questions it will be able to provide the user with detailed analysis and moreover it will underline past/present 
                                and future trends in this area. 
                            </p>

                                Once the dataset was selected, an obvious initial step consisted in data cleaning and prepossessing. Because the tasks were mainly divided by visualizations inside the team,
                                two main processing languages were used Python to prepare CSV data files for scatter plots and donut charts and GO to process JSON files for the map, calendar and treemap. This
                                step consisted mainly in counting the number of arrests based on different categories, like: location, race, gender etc. and it served as an input for the visualizations made in D3.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                In this paragraph more details about the dataset will be discussed, it was already mentioned that it has 1.16 millions rows and 17 columns. Different visualizations used data from 
                                different columns, for the map, the "Arrest Date", "Area Name" was mainly used to show the location of the arrest, for the scatter plots and donut charts: "Sex Code", "Descent Code" was mainly used,
                                the calendar used the "Arrest Date" column and finally the treemap used the "Charge Group Description" and "Charge Description". As it can be seen various columns were used to show different
                                parts of the story and especially to emphasize the whole picture of arrests in Los Angeles. The main scope of data processing of these columns was to count the number of arrests per specific unit such
                                as date, race, gender etc. The selection of the dataset was strongly based on the assumption that many different angles of the problem could be tackled and in the end it fulfilled the expectations.
