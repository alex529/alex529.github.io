                  <h5>#1 Explain in your own words the point of the jitter plot.</h5>
                  A jitter point is used to make graphs of data-points that are clustered together in specific points, therefore getting a good idea of how many data points are identical.

                  Figure 2-3 show the how big difference can make the alignment of the bins, and how easily a dataset can be misunderstood. By having the bin that large we lose information in the visualization.

I didn't give a detailed explanation in the video, but now that works to my advantage. I'll ask you guys to think about this and thereby create an excellent exercise: When can KDEs be misleading?</h5>
                  KDE can be misleading because it makes the visualization smooth, thus it looks that the graph has many data-points, when it can have just a couple.

                  CDF may be less intuitive because it visualizes a different kind of data instead of showing the amplitude it shows the frequency of the data-points.

                  <h5>#6 How is a Probability plot defined? What is it useful for? Have you ever seen one before?</h5>
                  Probability plot is defined as a technique to compare data sets and specifically if set of points of some data set behaves similar to for example: Gaussian distribution or other emperical observations.  
                  We did not specifically encounter plots related to probability plot.

                    This is the problem that is described in Simpson's paradox. If the data is grouped the trends are different compared with the trends that are generated from the aggregated data. By visualizing the data this error can be spotted very easily.

                  Box plots are used a lot in visualizing stocks, a lot of information can be shown using this plot, each box containing the median, min&max observations and lower&upper quartile.

                  A real world example of a multivariate relationship could be when examining the marketing impact of an advertisement in terms of turnover generated from <i>males</i> depending on the number of times the ad has featured in television. One could introduce a new variable e.g. <i>females</i> and the impact between males and females exposed to the ad can be measured.

                  Residuals are the reminder of the smoothening process, by looking at the residuals one can verify if the smoothening is accurate, the residuals shouldn't have a trend it should be balanced, having both positive and negative values.

                  Banking is the process where the scale of the graph is changed so the slopes are ~ 45 degrees, this change makes it much easier for the human bran to perceive change. In some cases to achieve 45 degrees the graph needs to be skewed to much the graph becomes unreadable, or it has to be stacked.

                  Figure 3-14 underlines the important point that the purpose of regression technique is to predict the values rather than to summarize the data, therefore making linear regression not a best fit but much more like a best predictor.

                  <h5>#10 Summarize the discussion of Graphical Analysis and Presentation Graphics on pp. 68-69 in your own words.</h5>
                  Graphical Analysis is the step that comes before the Presentation Graphics. The analysis is the part where one figures out what the dataset is about, figuring out the trend that data data fallows, at this point the visualization and the message that the plot transmits doesn't have to be 100% clear, as the person who is making the visualizations knows what he is looking at. While the presentation is more about transmitting the data to the audience in the most intuitive and easy to grasp way. At this point its more important that the message gets transmitted to the audience and that everything is clear, and self explanatory.
